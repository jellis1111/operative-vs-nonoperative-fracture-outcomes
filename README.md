# Operative vs Nonoperative Fracture Outcomes
A predictive analytics project comparing operative and non-operative treatments for pelvic and acetabular fractures using logistic regression.

# Predictive Modeling of Outcomes in Pelvic and Acetabular Fractures

This project was completed during my internship with the Musculoskeletal Institute (MSKI) at Atrium Health for the University of North Carolina at Charlotte's Data Science & Business Analytics graduate degree program. It analyzes patients' pelvic and acetabular injury outcomes via the PACE study comparing operative vs. non-operative treatments using predictive analytics.

## Project Summary

- Extracted and prepared a structured dataset from a large clinical database, performing initial data cleaning, consolidation, and transformation across multiple tables to enable analysis
- Created summary tables and identified unique patient records and features to support high-quality, patient-level insights
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand key variables and distributions before modeling
- Developed a logistic regression model to predict complication risk
- Factors included: age, sex, comorbidities, injury severity, PROMIS-29, Majeed scores, insurance, race, living status, and treatment type
- Found that operative treatment carried higher risk of complications
- Functional outcomes and living situations significantly influenced predicted risk
